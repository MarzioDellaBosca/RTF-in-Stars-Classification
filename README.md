The purpose of the project is to implement a Random Tree Forest algorithm to observe its learning ability and skill in classifying celestial bodies by dividing them into three major groups based on 
their distance from Earth. The initial dataset from which the data is acquired is the [Hipparcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos) catalog downloaded from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) platform.

The stars will be divided into three groups:

A: stars up to 400 light-years away from Earth.
B: stars from 400 light-years up to a maximum of 800 light-years away.
C: stars more than 800 light-years away from Earth.

After implementing and observing the classifierâ€™s reports, it will be compared with the Random Tree Regressor algorithm trained on the same training set.
